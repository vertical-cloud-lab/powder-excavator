"""Submit a single Edison Scientific **analysis** task with all the
per-concept design data, code, and images attached.

Per comment 4316944381 on PR #13 (issue #12) — submit, don't wait,
fetch in next session. The submitted bundle includes:

- brainstorm + per-concept design notes
- all 8 SCAD sources (cad/alternatives/A..H)
- all 8 iso PNGs and cutaway PNGs
- composite-spin.gif and composite-cutaway.png
- render-report.txt
- the pipeline driver script (scripts/render_alternatives.py)

The Edison API key is read from ``EDISON_API_KEY`` and never echoed.

QUERY = """We have refined eight alternative powder-dosing concepts (A
through H, see attached `brainstorm.md` and `per-concept-designs.md`)
into preliminary printable CAD on a Genmitsu 3018-Pro V2 desktop CNC
gantry (~300 x 180 x 45 mm work envelope, ~3 kg payload, GRBL). Each
concept is treated individually: parametric OpenSCAD source -> binary
STL (manifold checked with admesh, 0 bad edges across all 8) -> iso
PNG -> half-cutaway PNG -> 36-frame transparent rotating GIF ->
PrusaSlicer slice on the MK3S+ profile (PETG, 0.2 mm, 3 perimeters,
30% gyroid infill, 4 mm brim, supports on -- all 8 sliced cleanly).

NEW since the prior analysis submission: the project reviewer
reported that the raw SCAD renders alone were too abstract to
understand the mechanism, so we have added a per-concept
**annotated explainer panel** (title + iso render + half-cutaway +
numbered key-parts list + 3-step operation cycle) for each of A-H,
and a 4x2 composite of all eight panels (composite-panel.png). The
annotator script (scripts/annotate_alternatives.py, pure Pillow)
is also attached. The composite-panel.png is the best single
artefact to read first; please use it as the entry point for your
review of the geometry.

The eight SCAD sources, iso renders, cutaway sections, the three
composite previews (composite-panel.png, composite-spin.gif,
composite-cutaway.png), and the eight per-concept panels are all
attached. The pipeline driver (scripts/render_alternatives.py) and
the panel annotator (scripts/annotate_alternatives.py) are also
attached so you can see exactly what was generated.

Please give us a critical engineering review covering:

1. Per-concept printability and mechanism viability on the 3018-Pro
   V2: pull from the SCAD parameters and the cutaway cross sections.
   In particular flag any geometry where the cutaway suggests a
   bridging / overhang / wall-thickness problem that the slicer
   warned about but we may have missed.

2. Per-concept dose floor and RSD vs the published analogues
   already cited in our prior literature query (Besenhard 2015
   vibratory sieve-chute, Faulhammer 2014 dosator, Alsenz 2011
   PowderPicking, Hou 2024, Jiang 2023). We previously concluded G
   then A. With the geometry now visible, do you still agree, or
   does any other concept now look more promising?

3. Cohesive sub-100-um powder failure modes specific to each
   geometry: bridging in B's chambers, capillary plug variability
   in C, brush retention in D, hole-clogging in E, helix pull-down
   in F, etc. Cite peer-reviewed sources where available.

4. Specific incremental design changes (a sentence or two each per
   concept) that would most reduce variability or improve one-day-
   build success. Be concrete -- we are about to print these.

5. Anything obviously missing (a concept we should add, a
   peer-reviewed analogue we should be benchmarking against, a
   safety/EHS concern with HV / solenoid / heated alternatives).

Don't wait for us; we will fetch your answer in the next session.
