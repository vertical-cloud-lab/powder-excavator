"""Parametric CAD model of the powder-excavator (CadQuery / open-source).

This is the start of a **feedback-loop friendly** CAD pipeline for the
powder-excavator design described in ``docs/manuscript/main.tex``. CadQuery
was chosen over closed-source authoring tools (Rhino + Grasshopper, Fusion
Generative Design, nTop, Onshape FeatureScript) because it is

* pure Python and pip-installable on every major OS,
* fully scripted (no GUI required for parametric updates), so a design
  iteration is just a ``git diff`` and a re-run, and
* produces standards-compliant STEP and STL output that any open-source
  slicer (PrusaSlicer, OrcaSlicer, Cura) can consume.

The single source of truth for every dimension is :class:`ExcavatorParams`.
Changing one number there propagates through every part.

Usage
-----

Build all parts and the assembly to ``cad/build/`` (run from the repo root)::

    python -m cad.build

Run the design-for-manufacturing checks (per-part wall thickness, FDM
overhang angles, gantry-only kinematics)::

    python -m cad.dfm

Both modules import :func:`build_assembly` from this file, so the same
parametric model drives both the export and the feedback checks.
